PyTurbo.Cooling
====================
The following classes addresses the combination of adding heat pipes to airfoils. The basic idea of adding a heat pipe to a 3D Blade design is as follows: Picture designing a heat pipe loop on a paper then wrapping the paper within the airfoil at some offset from the exterior walls.

The Branch class deals with the construction of heatpipe loops in 2D
